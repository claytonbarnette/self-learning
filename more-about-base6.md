# More about the Base6 Languages

The more I use the term [**Base6 Languages**](base6.md) for myself, the more I feel that it should be a mini-standard. Not meaning that there should be PowePoints and hour-long YouTub talks on the subject popping up but that it should be implied in such a way amoung developers that when you mention the "Cloud" or any related services or technologies; one of these languages should come to mind.

## The core of the base6 stack is as follows: 

1. [Python]
2. [PHP]
3. [Node.js] (JavaScript)
4. [Go]
5. [Ruby]
6. [Java]

This stack is what I call the *"PPeanut butter aNd GRape Jelly (or Jam)"* Stack (PPNGRJ). I'm sure that plenty of embellised artwork can be done to iconify this concept and many different plays on the accronym can be added. I call this stack this because any of these languages can serve as the building blocks of a service, platform, framework, library or web page, written in the cloud. [Cloud Functions](https://openwhisk.apache.org/) is such a platform. 

The stack grows as more languages and frameworks are being added, C#, Rust, and .Net Core are a few. As [Web Assemby](https://webassembly.org/) and other technologies emerge and gain a wider acceptance, this list will continue to grow, bringing with it C, C++ and Objective C. 

For me, sometime in the future a base implementation of a private cloud for a developer may include some or all of these programming languages and frameworks. As applications move towards the browser and functional programming attributes are added to the cloud, both the production and developmnt environment workflows will change. For now, you have to know your **PPeaNut butter and GRape Jelly**. 

Oracle's **[Graal]** (JVM / DSL / Compiler / LSP) is such a project I feel can help us all head in the direction of all developers being **Polyglots** to a degree. I don't expect everyone to jump onboard right away, but **[Node.js]** took some time to gain its footing. If so, then it's a matter of time that these programming languages become a solid commonly know stack for all developers.

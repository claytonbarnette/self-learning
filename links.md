# Important Web Links

Below are links to websites, YouTube Channels, and other resources on the web I use to keep up with the ever changing landscape of the web. Some links are simply links I prefer and are not listed as something you have to use. If you find another resource that works for you, use it, share it, and let me know if I helped in some way.

# Self-Learning: Clayton Barnette

This Listing of Certificates of Completions that are contained in this repo are a collection of all of the certs I have received online while using [Lynda.com](https://www.lynda.com), which is now [Linkedin Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning). I have a few that are from other sites and interests posted here as well. I will always continue to learn and grow, and when I complete any additional courses, I will add my certificates here for easy viewing. I may even add an app some time in the future.

## How do I keep up?
To keep up with the ever changing landscape of the web, I use **Linkedin Learning** as a tool to learn new things quickly and to revisit or relearn existing technologies I may not have had time to revisit or learn in the past. I also use it as a starting point to learning in general and also spend a lot of time on developer portals, open-source websites, emerging technologies and methodologies sites reading. This gives me an endless amount of learning resources I use to stay current or ahead of the curve as I continue my path of life-long-learning.

When I can, I'll try to connect through social media directly with the developers and creators who are pushing the boundaries in open source and today's technology. So, if that's you, look for a Linkedin connection request from me in your inbox or connect with me first, by visiting my [Linkedin Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/claytonbarnette).

### Resources and Links

Here is a list of resources I use to lean and keep up with the ever-changing landscape of web development.

## What dose this all mean?
As an possible employee, I'm at least up-to-date on the latest that is out there and open to learning new things. It also means that the experience that I've gained over the years also serve as a resource for both the company and my co-workers/team. For some technologies it is hard to have 5 years of experience on a 2 year-old open source technology that just reached version 1.0. What I bring to the table is an open mind to what is possible, and a willingness to do the work to make it work for both the company and the community as a whole.

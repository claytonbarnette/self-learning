# Self-Learning: Clayton Barnette

The Listing of Certificates of Completions that are contained in this repo are a collection of all of the certs I have received online while using [Lynda.com](https://www.lynda.com) which is now [Linkedin Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning). I hava a few that are from other sites, as I continue to learn and complete additional certs, I will add them.

## How do I keep up?
To keep up with the ever changing landscape of the web, I use **Linkedin Learning** as a tool to learn new things quickly and to revisit or relearn existing technologies I may not have had time to revisit or learn in the past. I also use it as a starting point to learning in general and also spend a large amount of time on the developer sites of open-source projects and emerging technologies and methodologies. This gives me an endless amount of learning resources I use to stay current or ahead of the curve as I continue my path of life-long-learning.

## What dose this all mean?
As an possible employee, I'm at least up-to-date on the latest that is out there and open to learning new things. It also means that the experience that I've gained over the years also serve as a resource for both the company and my co-workers/team. For some technologies it is hard to have 5 years of experience on a 2 year-old open source technology that just reached version 1.0. What I bring to the table is an open mind to what is possible, and a willingness to do the work to make it work for both the company and the community as a whole.

### Quote me:

Below are some simple quotes I've said to myself and others over the years, these quotes have helped me continue the learning process and remind me to keep going, even when I don't get the job or they say I don't have enough experience or I don't fit their culture. The fact is, what I think and know (*and don't know*) at any point in time can change the world.

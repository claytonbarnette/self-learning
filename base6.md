# The Base 6 Languages 
These 6 Programming Languages are what I call the **"Base6"** languages because they are supported by most of the cloud providers GCP, Azure, AWS, IBM and others. I refer to this language stack as the *"PPeanut butter aNd GRape Jelly (or Jam)"* Stack (PPNGRJ). You have to know one of these to be functional as a developer. I go into more detail about the **Base6** languages [here](more-about-base6.md).

# Quote me:

Below are some simple quotes I've said to myself and others over the years, these quotes have helped me continue the learning process and remind me to keep going, even when I don't get the job or they say I don't have enough experience or I don't fit their culture. 

The fact is, what I think and know (*and don't know*) at any point in time can changes the world. I've also included some sayings that just fit the moment, some crazy moments, some of observation and others by dealing with people who always made simple moments crazy -- forcing me as a creative to use crazy-logic to fix the issue of the moment.
